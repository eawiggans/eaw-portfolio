      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of the Penn LPS Full Stack Web Development certificate program. I also have training in fine arts, design, horticulture, and First Aid/Naloxone administration. My diverse range of work experiences and personal interests have given me broad perspective, the ability to pick up new tasks and proficiencies on the fly, and the soft skills to manage a variety of work and interpersonal environments. I am endlessly curious; I was drawn to the field of web development because of the endless opportunities for learning and discovery.
