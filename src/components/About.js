          Hello, and welcome! I'm a web developer with an affinity for front-end design and implementation. I decided to formalize my self-study in the field, and graduated from the Penn LPS Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2023. I have training in fine arts and design, and draw on that background in my work. I have worked with nonprofit arts and public health organizations in non-web capacities, and am partiuclarly interested in supporting artists, arts institutions, and harm reductionists in communicating their work to the world through clean, engaging web design and smart data organization. I am available for freelance and project-based development, as well as long-term engagements. Good communication is key! Whether you are looking to upgrade your website or create one from scratch, I'd love to hear what you're thinking and help make your web dreams a reality.
