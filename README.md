# EAW Portfolio

## Description
In order to display my work to potential employers and the general public, this is a React-based portfolio website. It was created using React in order to display my proficiency with this current, in-demand tool as well as being a showcase for other, linked projects. This Web Development Bootcamp has been a difficult, eye-opening experience, and all this effort should be displayed to maximum effect in order to get jobs and pursue the career path I have begun here.

## Usage
Navigate to the project url. There the user will see navigation options in the header, with the initial page view being an About Me section. Users can click the links in the header to view work examples or to contact me via form, or to navigate back to the about me.
